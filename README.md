# Forged_Bank_Notes_with_SVM
Sometimes people find a way to forge bank notes. If there is a person looking at those notes and verifying their validity, it might be hard to be deceived by them. But what happens when there isn't a person to look at each note? Is there a way to automatically know if bank notes are forged or real?
This code is a practical application of the concept of classification using (Support Vector Machine). The problem we seek to solve here is (Detecting Forged Bank Notes). The model is trained on the dataset: (Data Banknote Authentication)

I was followed More than one method to reach the best score, and I separated the stages of developing the algorithm into multiple files, starting with (Initial SVClassifier), passing through (Opimaization SVClassifier), and finally (Implementing Other Flavors).
